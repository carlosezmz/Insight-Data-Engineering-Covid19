# Insight Data Engineering, Covid-19, A Smart Social Distancing

It is not secret Covid-19 has changed the way we live, from mandatory social distancing rules and sometimes hitting our most loved ones. In this project I will build data pipelines to process data and allow scientis discover HOTSTPOTS and investigate people gathering at large events.


The following [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e2P15HbtsJ3QiQXl0H0nv10ulYOfAeWvLBiVEU1aJ9k/edit#slide=id.g6b20e22304_0_78) show the methodology of how I improved a clustering algorithm to process geolocation data. The geolocation data was reduced in the number of rows to make more efficient queries and facillitate researcher to find hotspots.

The following 
shows an example of the precluster dataset can be used to find groups of people at a given time.
